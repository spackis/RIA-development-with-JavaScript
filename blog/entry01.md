#First blog post! 
Hello! My name is Emelie Bondeson, and I'm 21 years old. 

This is my third year of university studies. Previously I attended a web development program at Mittuniversitetet, 
but their program is only two years long, so I applied to Linn√©unniversitetet to complete a third year, and get a 
bachelor's degree. 

At Mittuniversitetet I read alot of development courses, mainly working with scripting languages as PHP and JavaScript, 
but we also did some programming in C#. 

My hopes and goals for this course is to learn something new that I will continue to have use for in the future. :) 

I'm using the Brackets editor (which is amazeballs)!
